Description: auto-generated package by debmake
 The Xz-Utils package contains programs for compressing and decompressing
 files. It provides capabilities for the lzma and the newer xz compression
 formats. Compressing text files with xz yields a better compression percentage
 than with the traditional gzip or bzip2 commands.
